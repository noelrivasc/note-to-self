/**
 * ABOUT THE CLASS NAME
 * Using a number as part of the class name may seem odd.
 *
 * The reason is that I may want to have different versions
 * of a similar component, but I'd rather not deprecate old versions,
 * have to keep content up to date or add logic to each component to 
 * respond to variations all.
 *
 * Keeping multiple versions of similar components active
 * could be a problem if the list grows too large, and could
 * also be a problem in terms of usability â€” but let's not get
 * ahead of ourselves here.
