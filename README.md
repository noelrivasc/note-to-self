# About the app

A simple mobile app based on React Native that offers exercises to wake up, improve focus and cool down.

I named it _Note To Self_ because there are some "rituals" that I'd like to do more often but usually forget once I get focused on something. 

Some examples: 

* Mindfulness
* Get up and do some juggling 
* Stretch
* Train apnea
* Reflect on current goals

Each exercise will be a simple audio, accompanied by a text description.

# Syllabus

This app will serve as a learning exercise and testing ground for React, React Native and related technologies.

This is what I'll be using:

* TypeScript
* React
* Redux
* React Native (targets: iOS and Android)
* The tooling around React Native
* Some testing with Jest

# Out of syllabus

Stuff I'm not attempting to learn or use at this point:

* ~~Jest or any other testing framework or technique~~
    * ðŸ¤” Actually, Jest will be the easiest way to test the store
